## 2018
A novel genetic circuit design was modelled to emulate resistor units to be used with biological op-amps. The resistor units were set up inside synells, which exploits quorum sensing to interact with the existing biological op-amp architecture via the negative feedback loop.

Check out the wiki for an in-depth explanation of the project!

## 2021
- :tada: Update! This project is a candidate for 2021 Team Canada-ISEF :tada:! I've extended this project to better model the behaviour of the synthetic minimal cells with a system of delay differential equations and using more experimental data to refine the model!
